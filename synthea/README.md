This demo project contains an exploratory analysis of synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data generated from the Synthea Patient Generator (Walonoski et al., JAMIA, 2017). Note that this EHR is synthetic, and while it may be modeled after real data, does not imply that the findings herein describe real phenomena in population health. This repository merely serves as a demonstration of analyses possible from Fulgens Consulting.

Major objectives in this work:

1. Assess population-level trends over time, such as increased frequencies of individuals expressing multiple allergies, or cholesterol measurements by age.

2. Reduce the dimensionalty of multi-modal data across the patient's clinical history to discern groupings of individuals by factors including age, sex, racial background, and disease status.

3. Classify sequences in clinical histories to predict future events, such as heart attacks.
